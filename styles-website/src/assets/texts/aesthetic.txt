<h1 class="orange centeredText">Anaesthetic Aesthetic</h1>

<p class="justifiedText">Anaesthetic Aesthetic is a 3D Stealth game made by a team of 3 people over the course of 3 months as a university project.</p>

<h3 class="orange">Background</h3>

<p class="justifiedText">We decided we wanted to make a game for a young target audience but also utilise a genre not typically associated with that age range - a stealth game. Our team also agreed on making the game 3D in order to gain more experience in 3D engines as well as to further familiarise ourselves with 3D level design and pathing. A story was created around this structure, depicting the plight of a young, socially awkward princess trying to infiltrate her own castle, which had been taken over by an evil witch, avoiding the bewitched guards as she does so.</p>
<br />
<p class="justifiedText">Using Unity 5, our team was able to create two levels for the game in the given timeframe. All the 3D models such as the characters, the buildings and interior elements were created from scratch in Blender 3D and given textures made in Adobe Photoshop. Characters were rigged and given animations for actions used within the game. All assets were assembled in Unity 5 and C# scripts created to handle player input and game logic. Unity 5's built-in pathing system was use of to create patrol routes for the guards before custom scripts took over to make the guards chase the player if spotted.</p>

<h3 class="orange">My roles</h3>

<p class="justifiedText">Due to the small team size and variance in ability, we all took on multiple roles to ensure the completion of the project and provide support for each other. My responsibilities were:</p>

<ul class="ul2">
	<li class="li2">Planning and updating deliverables and milestones.</li>
	<li class="li2">Creation of 3D Assets, including design, modelling, rigging and animations.</li>
	<li class="li2">Creating UV maps and textures for all models in Adobe Photoshop.</li>
	<li class="li2">Level design, planning and creation.</li>
	<li class="li2">Assembly of assets within Unity.</li>
	<li class="li2">C# Scripting for player interaction and gameplay mechanics.</li>
