<h3 class="orange">Background</h3>

<p class="justifiedText">Tetris is a web game based on the classic game of the same name. Created by a team of two using JQuery Mobile and Phaser, the game runs in the browser across all devices.</p>
<br />
<p class="justifiedText">Tetris requires the player to control falling tetrominos until they land and position them in such a way that they form a solid line, at which point the line disappears, points are given to the player and the difficulty increases. As the difficulty increases, the speed the tetrominos fall is increased. Once the blocks reach the top of the screen, the game is over and the player enters their name if their score is high enough for the leaderboard.</p>
<br />
<p class="justifiedText">JQuery Mobile was used to contain the game in a responsive framework which will adapt to the device screen is being displayed on, and allow the use of mobile-friendly User Interface elements for menus and controls. The application allows easy navigation between pages for "About", "Rules" and "Rankings" without requiring much in the way of device resources until the actual game is played, at which point the Phaser framework is utilised.</p>
